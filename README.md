# DaLiBor_predict2019
Online software for species distribution modelling (SDM) especially aiming on bryophytes and lichens in Czechia. Using scripting platform R (R Core Team 2016) package caret (Kuhn 2008) software returns two SDMs based on linear regression and random forest algorithms. Based on models, software returns the prediction map of potential habitat suitability for target species. Predictions are based on environmental data form CzechGrids d-base created by Institute of botany in 2018. There are climatic, topographic, landscape and forest data available. Output maps have cell size of 10 m, covering whole Czechia or its subset. The map is grid/raster in GeoTiff format of coordinate reference system EPSG:32633. Output is ready to be used in GIS software. DaLiBor_predict2019 has online graphical user interface, iterative task communicates with a user via emails providing model evaluations and asking for user inputs in prediction.
